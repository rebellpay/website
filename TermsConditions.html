      <li><strong>PROCEDURE FOR ENTERING INTO AND EXECUTING TRANSACTIONS</strong>
        <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <h3 style="font-size: 16px;">A. KYC/KYB PROCEDURE</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Each User, before using the Platform for the first time, must set up an Account and undergo a verification of identity (KYC) procedure for natural persons or a company verification (KYB) procedure for legal persons.</li>
            <li>The KYC/KYB procedure requires the User to provide the Company with personal or company data, as well as to send the relevant documents proving identity and residential address (e.g. identity card, passport) or company registration documents.</li>
            <li>The Company verifies the information and documents provided in accordance with the AML Act, verification may take up to 72 working hours. If, for reasons beyond the Company's control, the verification requires a longer period of time, the Company will immediately inform the Client of the delay and indicate the expected date of completion of the procedure.</li>
            <li>Once the KYC/KYB process has been completed, the User undertakes to update his/her data regularly and to maintain active two-factor authentication (2FA).</li>
            <li>In certain cases, the Company may apply enhanced financial security measures and request additional information from the User in accordance with the relevant provisions of the AML Act and other generally applicable laws and guidelines from public authorities.</li>
            <li>By making a payment using the Platform, the Customer also agrees to share his/her full KYC profile and payment details with Merchant which is necessary to complete the transaction for AML regulation reasons.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3 style="font-size: 16px;">B. TRANSACTION EXECUTION PROCEDURE</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>The Customer, wishing to complete a Transaction, views the Merchant's Offer on the external platform and then manually transfers the Offer details to the Platform's transaction window by entering:
              <ol>
                <li><strong>The unique transaction identifier</strong> provided by Merchant in the Offer or automatically generated by the platform on which the Offer is issued - an individual string of characters on the basis of which the Company decodes all the data necessary to complete the payment; its provision by the Customer is a prerequisite for completing the Transaction.</li>
                <li><strong>The amount of the transfer and the currency</strong>, as indicated in the Offer. In addition, after passing the process on the Company's Platform, it transfers from its KYC/KYB compliant bank account to: The account number indicated on the Platform together with the Payment Title indicated on the Platform, which is unique for each transaction</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The Customer shall ensure that all the identification data referred to in paragraph 1 are correct and in accordance with the data posted by Merchant on the external platform. If the Customer enters incorrect identification data, resulting in an incorrect payment, the Customer may be charged a Recovery Fee as detailed in the Tariff of Fees.</li>
            <li>Once the identification data referred to in clause 1 has been correctly entered, the Customer is obliged to transfer the funds to the individual, single-assigned payment account number indicated by the Company in the Platform's transaction interface. The payment operation must be initiated exactly to this account, with the title of the transfer unchanged and the amount and currency corresponding to the values presented in the transaction window.</li>
            <li>The Customer is obliged to make the payment within 1 (one) hour of the acceptance of the Offer (Time Window for fast payments) if the payment is made through a scheme allowing immediate transfers or within 24 hours of the acceptance of the Offer (Time Window for slow payments). Failure to pay within this time window entitles the Company to automatically cancel the Transaction. This provision is one of several mechanisms to protect the parties from potential abuse.</li>
            <li>Each individual Transaction constitutes a separate civil law contract between the Customer, the Company and the Merchant. The conclusion of this contract occurs when the OTP code sent to the Customer's email address is entered on the Platform. Subsequently, an additional re-confirmation of the conclusion of the contract is the crediting of the full fiat amount indicated in the Offer to the Company's payment account referred to in paragraph 3. Once this account is credited with the relevant amount, a contractual relationship is established between the parties, under which the Merchant is obliged to transfer the virtual currency to the Customer and the Company is obliged to temporarily store the fiat funds and release them in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Transaction.</li>
            <li>The conclusion of the agreement is confirmed by the automatic generation of a confirmation of the Transaction sent to the Client's and Merchant's e-mail addresses provided at the registration stage, as well as by changing the status of the Transaction in the Panel to "accepted".</li>
            <li>Once the Transaction agreement has been concluded and the funds have been credited to the payment account, the Company blocks the fiat funds until it receives confirmation of the execution of the shipment of virtual currencies from Merchant.</li>
            <li>The Merchant, after receiving confirmation of the blocking of fiat funds, undertakes to send virtual currencies directly to the Client's wallet address indicated in the Offer or communicated by the Client in the text communication available in the Panel.</li>
            <li>The Merchant is obliged to confirm the fact of the transfer of virtual currencies in the Panel by changing the status of the Transaction accordingly.</li>
            <li>The Customer is obliged to confirm the receipt of virtual currencies in the Panel or by email immediately. If the Customer does not raise any objections within 24 hours of the Transaction being given the status "sent" by Merchant, the Transaction is deemed to have been successfully completed and the accumulated fiat funds will be released to Merchant.</li>
            <li>In the event of any doubts or problems related to the completion of the Transaction, the Customer shall have the right to initiate the dispute procedure described in Section IX of these Terms and Conditions.</li>
            <li>The Customer is obliged to exercise due diligence when entering data and making payments, as it is responsible for their correctness and timeliness. The Company shall not be liable for any irregularities resulting from errors made by the Customer when completing the transaction window and/or when paying for the Offer from his/her account.</li>
            <li>Once the funds are credited to the Merchant's account, the Company will settle (transfer the funds) according to the Merchant's instruction (based on the completed application form, in which the data for the transfer will be provided), whereby the Company has the right to withdraw from the instruction if such a transfer would violate the Company's AML policy.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li><strong>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRONEOUS OR UNAUTHORISED PAYMENT</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>The customer is fully responsible for the correctness of the data provided during the transfer. If incorrect data such as the bank account number, beneficiary, or incorrect title of the transfer or an incomplete amount is provided, resulting in the cancellation of the Transaction or the need for additional verification, the Client will be charged a Recovery Fee as set out in the Tariff of Fees - unless the provision of incorrect data was due to circumstances beyond the Client's control.</li>
          <li>If a payment has been made from a payment account whose details do not match the information verified during the KYC procedure or if there is a suspicion of an unauthorised or fraudulent transaction, the Company shall take verification and recovery action, for which a Recovery Fee shall also be charged.</li>
          <li>In the event of an unauthorised payment, withdrawal of a payment by the Customer's bank or other circumstances indicating a risk of a fraudulent transaction, the Company has the right to temporarily suspend the release of funds and inform the relevant authorities in accordance with the AML Act.</li>
          <li>The Company shall only carry out technical recovery activities related to the identification and return of funds. All banking costs, network fees and exchange rate risks are to be borne by the Customer.</li>
          <li>If a Merchant is responsible for the incorrect execution of a Transaction, in particular if he has not sent virtual currency in accordance with the terms of the Offer, he will be charged a Recovery Fee as set out in the Tariff of Fees.</li>
          <li>The Company reserves the right to claim compensation in excess of the Recovery Fee if the actual costs incurred by the Company as a result of an incorrect or unauthorised payment exceed this fee.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li><strong>FEES AND BILLING</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>The Company charges Merchant a Transaction Fee as set out in the Fee Schedule, which is charged automatically upon release of fiat funds by the Platform or upon resolution of a dispute in Merchant's favour.</li>
          <li>The Company may charge a Recovery Fee to the party that caused the fiat payment error or provided an incorrect virtual currency address. This fee is purely cost-based - it serves to cover the actual operating expenses and any bank charges incurred in the recovery of funds and is not a source of profit for the Company. Its amount corresponds to a maximum of two times the standard transaction fee set out in the Tariff of Fees, where the rules for its calculation are described in detail.</li>
          <li>All fees are presented to the User prior to the conclusion of a Transaction or before ordering an additional service and are visible in the history of the Transaction in the User's Account on the Platform.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li><strong>LIABILITY AND RISKS</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>The Company is responsible for the correct acceptance and release of fiat funds on the payment account in connection with the execution of the Transaction, as well as for the correct operation of the Platform and the dispute procedure concerning fiat payments. The Company is not responsible for the performance of the obligations to send virtual currencies, which remain the sole responsibility of Merchant.</li>
          <li>The Company may temporarily suspend an Account or a Transaction if it reasonably suspects fraud, violation of the Terms and Conditions or applicable laws. In such a case, the Company may block the relevant funds necessary to cover the costs of the investigation.</li>
          <li>The Company is not responsible for erroneous data provided by the Customer, in particular regarding the bank account number or the address of the virtual currency wallet.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong>

            <ol>
              <li>releasing the fiat funds held in the payment account in favour of the Merchant if the correct delivery of the virtual currency is confirmed,</li>
              <li>returning the fiat funds to the Customer if the Merchant has not delivered the virtual currency or has delivered it incorrectly,</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>The Company's internal dispute resolution concludes the dispute procedure on the Platform, but does not limit the parties' right to pursue their claims in court or through out-of-court dispute resolution (ADR) methods.</li>
